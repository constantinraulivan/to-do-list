# To Do List

An app that allows you to create a To Do List with your daily tasks and mark them as done as you do them. Every day, at midnight, the list will reset (all tasks will be marked as not completed). Tasks can be stored using external [API](#connect-with-api). 

This app was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
